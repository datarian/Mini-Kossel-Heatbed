===================

Heatbed design for mini kossels.

Features:
- Fits kossel mini
- Solid construction using lasered 1mm aluminum sheets
- thermal isolation towards the frame using ptfe tubing and PE washers for minimized heat loss and faster heatup times.
- Cork isolation under the heater to protect motors underneath
 
Required materials:
- Cut alu_base, alu_fixture, alu_ring from 1 mm aluminum sheet
- cork, circular, diameter around 180mm
- kapton bed heater, 160mm diameter
- 3 pieces of ptfe tubing 6mm od, ideally 3mm id, 6mm long
- 3x M3x10 and nuts to fix the whole thing to your kossel

Putting it all together
1. Align alu_fixture and alu_ring, mark the cutout of alu_ring on the fixture
2. Glue your kapton heater on the marked alu_fixture
3. Prepare cork circle, cut out a hole big enough to get the cables of the heater and thermistor through
4. Prepare the screws and ptfe-tubing, put everything together. From top to bottom: 1. alu_fixture with glued-on kapton heater, 2. alu_ring, 3. cork circle, 4. alu_base
